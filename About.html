        <p class="text">The words and phrases that make up slang constitute a nonstandard vocabulary in any language. Some slang terms become standard vocabulary and their origins as slang are forgotten. Blizzard, meaning a violent snowstorm, is such a word, as are movie, skyscraper, video, and mob. Sometimes a term can persist as slang but become almost standard in use because there is nothing to replace it. Soap opera, referring to a serial drama on radio or television, and cliff-hanger, for adventure film serials, are examples.</p>

        <p class="text">A slang expression may be a euphemism—a term that makes something sound better than it really is. Hawk, for instance, is a slang word meaning warmonger. Often euphemisms are created to disguise unpleasant realities. During the Vietnam War “protective reaction strike” was a military term for a bombing mission. When mentioned in news releases it was intended to sound like a defensive measure instead of an offensive one. In politics, the term revenue enhancement was used in the early 1980s to disguise a tax increase.</p>

        <p class="text">Subgroups in society create their own specialized vocabularies, called argot—frequently using standard words but giving them different and more colorful meanings. Such use of words begins as an insider language. While not necessarily intended to confuse outsiders, the words suggest a common bond of understanding and a special relationship between those who use them. College students, African Americans, professional athletes, musicians, soldiers, finance professionals, and others create their own inventive vocabularies</p>

      <p class="title">COMPUTER SCIENCE</p>
      <p class="text">

the study of computers, including their design (architecture) and their uses for computations, data processing, and systems control. The field of computer science includes engineering activities such as the design of computers and of the hardware and software that make up computer systems. It also encompasses theoretical, mathematical activities, such as the design and analysis of algorithms, performance studies of systems and their components by means of techniques like queueing theory, and the estimation of the reliability and availability of systems by probabilistic techniques. Since computer systems are often too large and complicated to allow a designer to predict failure or success without testing, experimentation is incorporated into the development cycle. Computer science is generally considered a discipline separate from computer engineering, although the two disciplines overlap extensively in the area of computer architecture, which is the design and study of computer systems.<br><br>

The major subdisciplines of computer science have traditionally been (1) architecture (including all levels of hardware design, as well as the integration of hardware and software components to form computer systems), (2) software (the programs, or sets of instructions, that tell a computer how to carry out tasks), here subdivided into software engineering, programming languages, operating systems, information systems and databases, artificial intelligence, and computer graphics, and (3) theory, which includes computational methods and numerical analysis on the one hand and data structures and algorithms on the other.</p>
